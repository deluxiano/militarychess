# # Military Chess

Chinese military chess (Chinese: 陸戰棋) is a two-player Chinese board game . It bears many similarities to L'Attaque. It is a non-perfect abstract strategy game of partial information, since each player has only limited knowledge concerning the disposition of the opposing pieces. 

- **Objective**: The primary goal is to capture the opponent's flag.
- **Players**: Two players compete against each other, each managing their own army set up on a distinctive battlefield represented on a board.
- **Game Play**: Players take turns to move pieces with the aim to capture the opponent's flag or eliminate opposing pieces.

## Components

### Board

- **Soldier Stations**: Regular playing spaces for movement and attacks.
- **Camps**: Safety spots where pieces cannot be attacked.
- **Headquarters**: Each side has two; one holds the flag.
- **Front Line and Mountain Borders**: Serve as barriers; pieces cannot stop here but must pass over.

### Pieces

Each piece has a specific role and movement ability:

- **Engineer**: Can destroy Landmines without being destroyed and move continuously on railroad tracks.
- **Grenade**: Destroys itself along with any piece it attacks.
- **Landmine**: Does not move; destroys any attacking piece except for the Engineer.
- **Flag**: The game's objective; capturing the flag wins the game.
